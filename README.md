# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project is focused on predicting whether a customer will default on their credit card payment the next month, based on historical behavioral and demographic data. The analysis and model development were carried out in a Jupyter Notebook and are available at the following link:

## Project Goals

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of credit card users.
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality.
- Train and evaluate classification models to predict defaults.
- Interpret and visualize the results.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on 30,000 credit card clients, including:

- Demographic features (e.g. age, gender, education)
- Credit history (e.g. payment status, bill amount, payment amount)
- Default status (target variable)

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost

Each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.
